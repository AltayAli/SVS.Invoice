After you load the file, the system saves it to the database, then the background job will read data and write them to the appropriate tables. Background job runs automatically by every 30 minutes. After the process, detailed information about the process will be sent to the email specified in the EmailSettings>SendMail property in appsettings.json or appsettings.Development.json. Because of that please check the configurations.



## Configuration

You have to config some properties. Open appsettings.json or appsettings.Developer.json file.
- Update ConnectionStrings > DataConnection. Please select the connection string for MS SQL database.
- Update EmailSettings.

Finally you can run the application. When you run the application, database will automatically generate.
 
# SYS.Invoice.BLL

There is some business logic. Actually, I used a repository pattern in the library. You can also find some helper services and models to serve these services.
# SYS.Invoice.Models

You can find a database connection, migrations, some entities, data transfer objects, and AutoMapper profiles.
I used EF Core for a database connection. 
# SVS.Invoice.UnitTests
You can find unit tests for repositories. I used NUnit for tests.
